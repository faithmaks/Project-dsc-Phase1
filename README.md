## Project-dsc-Phase1
#Box Office Bangers! What's the secret?
## Overview
Movies have been a lucrative business for years now. But What makes a movie profitable or likeable.
Is it the actor? Producers, directors or the studio? Or perharps the marketing? 
How do you keep up with the times and trends and more especiallialy, digitalization?
In this project I will analyze what makes a Box Office movie a success. What role preproduction, production post production play in the success of a movie. The importance of picking the right people,genre and distributor. In the success of a movie. What goes into running a studio that produces successful movie?
## Business Understanding
In the movie industry, everything has to run like a well oiled machine from writting, production to the release. It is important for prepoduction to work smoothly for other departments and aspects to run as well.

## The Data Source
The source of data for this project are:
1. Box Office Mojo
2. Rotten Tomatoes
3. The MovieDB
4. The Numbers
5. IMDB

These websites have been collecting and analysing movie data for a while and therefore have extensive insight in the movie business.

## Data Understanding and Analysis
The data has five important tables that give insight into what goes into production for a movie to stand out or do well in theatres and to give a profit.
I narrowed it down to 5 noticeable things:
1. The Budget
2. Popularity
3. Writers and directors
4. Producers
5. Genres
6. Ratings
I used Python and Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, cleaning and inferences.


## Data Description
A movie can do well domesticaly or internationaly/ in the foreign market. 
Some genres can also do better than others. 
Some directors and writers receive better ratings and also appear more in the box office than others and therefore having them produce/write might impact movie's success.



## Conclusions
For a movie to succeed, you need to get the right production team, find the right distributor and reduce the budget

## Summary
A movie has to have a lot of things done right for it to succeed, but sometimes it might be just luck. Either way, the directors, writers, genre and distributors have to be picked right.
